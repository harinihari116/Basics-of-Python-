# Hierarchical Inheritance Example

class Teddy:
    def acting(self):
        print("Teddy is acting")

    def laughing(self):
        print("Shinchan is laughing")

class Barbie(Teddy):
    def dancing(self):
        print("Barbie is dancing")

# Creating objects
cartoon1 = Shinchan()
cartoon1.acting()
cartoon1.laughing()

cartoon2 = Barbie()
