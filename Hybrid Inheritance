# Hybrid Inheritance Example

class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Parrot(Bird):  # Inherit from Bird to allow access to fly()
    def play(self):
        print("Playing")

class Eagle(Bird):
    def catch_snake(self):
        print("Catching snake")

class Crow(Parrot, Eagle):  # Multiple Inheritance (Hybrid)
    def sight(self):
        print("Sighting")

# Create Crow object
crow = Crow()

# Accessing all inherited methods
crow.fly()
crow.play()
crow.catch_snake()
crow.sight()
